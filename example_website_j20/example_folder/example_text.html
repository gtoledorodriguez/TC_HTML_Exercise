    <p>Complete all the exercises in this document. Work independently. Outside assistance on this assignment is not allowed. If you need clarification on the instructions, please email me.</p>

    <h2>Instructions for Exercise Two</h2>
    <p>These problems ask you to think about different types of letters as well as style and document design principles we covered in class. Carefully read the instructions for each problem.</p>

    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
    <p>I&#27;ll evaluate you on your ability to apply skills and approaches to letter writing and document design that we learned in class to address the issues in each problem. Now that you have your style homework back, try to avoid repeat style errors.</p>

HW 5

 Try to put the instructions from the old Writing Exercise Three pdf (in this folder) into valid HTML5 format (the document is from the last time I taught the course).

 I've put in all the text and <head> tags, so you just need to add structural tags to the body text.
 You'll need to use the following tags:
 h1, h2, p, strong, ol, li, and em.
 Remember, the basic rules for HTML5, especially that open tags must close in order.
 Use the W3C validator to make sure it's valid HTML5 before you submit.

 Remember: HTML5 is about document structure. Don't worry about the appearance in a browser.
 Think about the the text in terms of its position in the information structure (is this a header? is it emphasized? is it a list? etc.).

 Modify special characters to be standard utf-8 characters in the text editor (special characters will screw up your validation).
